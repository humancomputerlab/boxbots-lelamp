# Prerequisites for Building LeLamp

Before starting your LeLamp build, ensure you have the necessary skills, tools, and time to complete this project successfully.

## Skill Level Requirements

**Intermediate to Advanced** - This project requires:

- **Electronics experience**: Soldering, basic circuit understanding, component identification
- **3D printing knowledge**: Printer operation, material selection, post-processing
- **Software comfort**: Command line usage, SSH, basic Linux administration
- **Mechanical assembly**: Precision work with small components, heat inserts, servo mounting

**Estimated build time**: 1-2 hours (assuming prints are complete

## Required Tools

### Electronics Tools

- Soldering iron (temperature controlled, 15-25W)
- Solder (60/40 rosin core, 0.6-0.8mm)
- Wire strippers
- Small screwdrivers (Phillips #0, #1, flathead 2-3mm)
- Multimeter for continuity testing

### Mechanical Tools

- Heat insert soldering iron tip OR dedicated heat insert tool
- M2, M2.5 and M3 Allen keys/hex drivers
- Small pliers (needle nose)
- Wire cutters/flush cutters
- Digital calipers (for verification)

## Safety Warnings

⚠️ **ELECTRICAL SAFETY**

- Always disconnect power when making connections
- Use proper ESD precautions when handling Pi and servo driver
- Main power supply is 5V - verify correct voltage before connection
- Double-check polarity before powering on

⚠️ **MECHANICAL SAFETY**

- Heat inserts reach 200°C+ - use appropriate tools
- Servo horns under tension can snap - wear eye protection
- Small parts present choking hazard

**Total estimated cost (United States): $310.64 USD**

## Required External Resources

Before starting, ensure you have access to:

- **3D Printer** or printing service
- **Computer** for Pi setup and servo configuration
- **WiFi network** for Pi connectivity
- **LeLamp Runtime Repository**: https://github.com/humancomputerlab/lelamp_runtime

## Time Planning

### Phase 1: Preparation (15-30 minutes)

- Download and review all documentation
- Source all components

### Phase 2: Electronics Prep (30-45 minutes)

- Test all components individually
- Solder headers and connectors
- Set up Raspberry Pi OS
- Configure servo IDs

### Phase 3: Assembly (30 min - 1 hour)

- Install heat inserts
- Mount servos in 3D printed parts
- Route wiring through body
- Assemble head components
- Final integration and testing

## Pre-Build Checklist

- [ ] All components sourced and verified working
- [ ] 3D parts printed and post-processed
- [ ] Tools and workspace prepared
- [ ] Software downloaded and accounts created
- [ ] Safety equipment ready
- [ ] Adequate time allocated (don't rush!)
